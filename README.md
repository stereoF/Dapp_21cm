# Dapp_21cm Decentralized paper publishing smart contract.

DeSci-21cm is a decentralized paper publishing platform that consists of three projects: front-end, back-end, and contracts. This repository contains the contract project.

There are three contracts in total: preprint contract, role management contract for DeSci journals, and DeSci main contract which inherits the role management.

The contract language is solidity and the development, testing, and deployment framework used is Hardhat.

The project website is www.desci-21cm.com. We have published a detailed introduction of this project in the form of a paper in the decentralized journal "Decentralization" of DeSci-21cm: http://www.desci-21cm.com/desci/paperinfo/0x2bBD3556fe5765930ad55288c34A51EA706DE50F/QmSoSM16ihjkKuaS7m5Arbt6PpeDwohaKBesWZEDGLJf4t.
